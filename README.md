# Hey there 👋

I'm Atika, a Computer Science student and tech enthusiast.  

I love creating cozy and small projects for practice and fun, and I value imagination in everything I work on.  
I mostly work with web technologies — Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.  
I also explore graphic design and UI/UX, and I’m currently diving into game development and animation.  

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be sharing small projects, experiments, and things I’m learning. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.
